# Feature Engineering for Data

This repository is dedicated to learning and implementing various **feature engineering techniques** essential for **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning** projects. Each concept is demonstrated with examples in Jupyter Notebook files.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following topics:

### 1. Handling Missing Values
- **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)**: Methods to address data points missing independently of other variables.
- **Missing at Random (MAR)**: Techniques to handle missingness dependent on observed data.
- **Missing Not at Random (MNAR)**: Strategies to handle data missing due to an unobserved reason.

Notebook: [Handling Missing Values](/Handling_Missing_Values.ipynb)

### 2. Handling Imbalanced Dataset
- **Up Sampling**: Techniques to oversample the minority class.
- **Down Sampling**: Methods to undersample the majority class.
- **Using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**: A powerful technique to create synthetic samples.

Notebook: [Handling Imbalanced Data](/Handling_Imbalance_data.ipynb)

### 3. Handling Outliers
Explores methods to detect and treat outliers in data to ensure robust model performance.

Notebook: [Handling Outliers](/Handling_Outlier.ipynb)

### 4. Data Encoding
- **Nominal/One-Hot Encoding**: Encoding categorical variables with one-hot vectors.
- **Label and Ordinal Encoding**: Converting categories into integers.
- **Target Guided Ordinal Encoding**: Encoding categories based on their relationship to the target variable.
